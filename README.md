Created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

The application will take in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

Initializing node bamazon.js in the command line brings up the storefront. It will ask you what you'd like to purchase by item number and how many and will delete the quantity from the MSQL database. If there isnt enough items left, it will cancel your order. If the order goes through, it will tell you the price of the order as well.
